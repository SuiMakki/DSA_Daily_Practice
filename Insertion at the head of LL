Insertion at the head of LL
100
Easy
Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer X, insert a node with value X at the head of the linked list and return the head of the modified list.
The head is the first node of the linked list.

Examples:
Input: head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, X = 7
Output: head -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
Explanation:
7 was added as the 1st node.

Input: head, X = 7
