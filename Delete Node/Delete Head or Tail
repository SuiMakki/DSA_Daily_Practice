There is a singly-linked list head and we want to delete a node node in it.

You are given the node to be deleted node. You will not be given access to the first node of head.

All the values of the linked list are unique, and it is guaranteed that the given node node is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
All the values before node should be in the same order.
All the values after node should be in the same order.
Custom testing:

For the input, you should provide the entire linked list head and the node to be given node. node should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
The output will be the entire list after calling your function.
 

Example 1:


Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.

        node.val = node.next.val;

Delete Last Node of Linked List
Mark as Completed
Problem Statement: Given a Linked List, delete the tail of the list and print the updated list.

Examples
Input: 0->1->2
Output: 0->1

-------------------------------------
// Definition for singly linked list
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = null;
    }
}

class Solution {                                     //actual code start
    // Function to delete tail node of linked list
    public Node deleteTail(Node head) {
        // If list is empty or has one node
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return null;
        }

        // Traverse to the second last node
        Node curr = head;
        while (curr.next.next != null) {
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        // Delete tail node
        curr.next = null;

        // Return updated head
        return head;                              //actual code start
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Node head = new Node(1);
        head.next = new Node(2);
        head.next.next = new Node(3);

        Solution obj = new Solution();
        head = obj.deleteTail(head);

        // Print list after deletion
        Node temp = head;
        while (temp != null) {
            System.out.print(temp.data + " ");
            temp = temp.next;
        }
    }
}
