Floor in a Binary Search Tree

Mark as Completed

Problem Statement: Given a Binary Search Tree and a key, return the floor of the given key in the Binary Search Tree.
Floor of a value refers to the value of the largest node in the Binary Search Tree that is smaller than or equal to the given key. If the floor node does not exist, return nullptr.

---------------------------------------

class Solution {
    // Function to find the floor of a key
    // in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
    public int floorInBST(TreeNode root, int key) {
        // Initialize the floor variable
        // to store the floor value
        int floor = -1;

        // Traverse the BST until reaching
        // the end or finding the key
        while (root != null) {
            // If the key is found, assign it
            // as the floor value and return
            if (root.val == key) {
                floor = root.val;
                return floor;
            }

            // If the key is greater than the current
            // node's value, move to the right subtree
            if (key > root.val) {
                // Update the floor with the current node's
                // value and move to the right subtree
                floor = root.val; ----------------------------------------> just is the difference in floor where we store right.val in floor
                root = root.right;
            } else {
                // If the key is smaller than the current
                // node's value, move to the left subtree
                root = root.left;
            }
        }
        // Return the computed floor value
        return floor;
    }
}
---------------------------------------
✅ Time Complexity

O(h) where h = height of BST

Worst case (skewed tree): O(n)

Best case (balanced tree): O(log n)

✅ Space Complexity

O(1) (iterative, no recursion stack)

Same as searchBST.
