Mark as Completed
Problem Statement: Given the head of a linked list, determine the length of a loop present in the linked list. If there's no loop present, return 0.

Examples
Input: image
Output: 3
Explanation: A cycle exists in the linked list starting at node 3 -> 4 -> 5 and then back to 3. There are 3 nodes present in this cycle.

Input: image
Output: 0
Explanation: The linked list is linear and does not have a loop hence return 0.

// Node class represents a node in a linked list
class Node {
    // Data stored in the node
    int data;

    // Pointer to the next node
    Node next;

    // Constructor with both data and next node
    Node(int data1, Node next1) {
        data = data1;
        next = next1;
    }

    // Constructor with only data
    Node(int data1) {
        data = data1;
        next = null;
    }
}

// Solution class containing the loop length function
class Solution {
    // Function to return the length of loop using Floyd's Algorithm
    public int lengthOfLoop(Node head) {
        // Initialize slow and fast pointers
        Node slow = head;
        Node fast = head;

        // Loop until fast and slow meet
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            // Move slow by one step
            slow = slow.next;

            // Move fast by two steps
            fast = fast.next.next;

            // If slow and fast meet, loop detected
            if (slow == fast) {
                // Count the length of the loop
                return countLoopLength(slow);
            }
        }

        // No loop found
        return 0;
    }

    // Function to count loop length
    public int countLoopLength(Node meetingPoint) {
        // Start from meeting point
        Node temp = meetingPoint;
        int length = 1;

        // Move until we meet again
        while (temp.next != meetingPoint) {
            temp = temp.next;
            length++;
        }
        return length;
    }
}
